# HTTP/SSE Transport Troubleshooting

## Issue: "Received request before initialization was complete"

This error occurs when the MCP client sends requests before the server initialization handshake is finished.

### Symptoms
```
WARNING - Failed to validate request: Received request before initialization was complete
```

### Root Cause
The SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport initialization isn't completing properly between the MCP client and server.

### Solutions

#### 1. Use Stdio Transport (Recommended)
The stdio transport is more reliable and doesn't have these initialization issues:

```bash
# Use stdio instead of HTTP
web-auth-mcp
```

Configure your MCP client with:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "web-auth-mcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "web_auth_mcp.server"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Debug HTTP Transport
If you need HTTP transport, enable debug logging:

```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
web-auth-mcp-http
```

#### 3. Check MCP Client Configuration
Ensure your MCP client is configured correctly for SSE:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "web-auth-mcp": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 4. Verify Endpoints
Test the endpoints manually:

```bash
# Test SSE endpoint (should establish connection)
curl -N -H "Accept: text/event-stream" http://localhost:8080/sse

# Test message endpoint (should accept POST)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/message -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

### Current Status
- ✅ **Stdio Transport**: Fully working and tested
- ⚠️ **HTTP/SSE Transport**: Has initialization timing issues
- ✅ **Core Functionality**: HTTP requests with authentication work perfectly

### Recommendation
Use the **stdio transport** (`web-auth-mcp`) for reliable operation. The HTTP transport is experimental and may have timing issues with certain MCP clients.
